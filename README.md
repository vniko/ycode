## About

 This is the complete assignment for YCode https://gist.github.com/arunas-smala/05148271da10f1743d216eab206c9f24

I used "Fractal" package as a presenter layer. Although for such a small project it makes no benefit, it empowers real world API applications.

I also implemented "Repository" pattern to find and create entities for the same "show off" reason :)

For the Vue templating i used Pug (https://pugjs.org/)  syntax as i like it a lot. It makes you more productive and your code more readable.  

The API docs are available under "/docs-api". They are compiled with  APIDOC (https://apidocjs.com/)
